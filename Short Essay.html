<h1>Coding Class Short Essay</h1>
<p>Hey there! 
    My name is Matthew and this my Short Essay </p>

<h2>The Similarities and Diffences between goku and Saitama </h2>


<p>In this story, In the anime community, people often debate which character is the strongest. 
    Most of the time, the two contenders who are up for debate are Saitama, the main protagonist from One Punch Man and Goku, the lead character from Dragon Ball. Both characters are famously known for their absurd strength and feats. For example, Goku is known for being so strong he can grow and change the color of his hair. Saitama is known for training so hard he went bald. Although their feats are different, they have one similarity: defeating powerful opponents.

    However, Saitama’s strength is often undermined by fans when compared to Goku. For instance, yes, Goku is a Saiyan, an alien warrior race, who has the ability to enhance his strength by transforming into a Super Saiyan. And Saitama… is just an ordinary human. But! Saitama’s strength is incomprehensible.Though both protagonists are powerhouses, it's evident that they have glaring differences from one another. One is a brawl-hungry extraterrestrial being, while the other is a convenience store part-timer turned hero. The fact they can even be compared on equal footing at all shows Saitama has the advantage in this battle of power. He exhibits the same strength effortlessly and yet still has more room for growth. At this point, he hasn't ever needed to use his full power, whereas Goku frequently needs to reach his limits.</p>


<br>Saitama has trained to the point that he broke his strength limiter. This means as each day goes by he continues to get stronger without doing anything. He’s so strong that he became bored of fighting. So, he often defeats his opponents with one punch.

On the other hand, there’s Goku, a Saiyan that has to continuously train and fight strong opponents in order to ascend to a higher level. He’s so addicted to achieving the pinnacle of strength that he searches for stronger opponents to face.

The mere comparison of strength between the two characters is crazy. Goku is an extraterrestrial being who has to lose a fight in order to get stronger. Saitama is a man that can defeat any foe with a single punch.

If the two of them were to face off in a one-on-one battle, Saitama would easily win. The fight wouldn’t last a second let alone enough time for Goku to transform into a Super Saiyan. Simply put, I guess being bald is better than growing your hair. </br> 

<br>Saitama is a B-class hero and just a plain old human. He experiences everything an average human does and ages with time. Additionally, he has no special abilities like regenerative or magical powers. Goku, meanwhile, comes from an alien warrior race with superpowers, he can fly, use ki blasts and enhance his strength through his Super Saiyan forms. Saiyans age slowly compared to humans, as stated by Vegeta in Season 9 of Dragon Ball, which is a huge advantage.

Despite this massive gap between their basic DNA structure, Saitama displays as much strength as a regular Saiyan without any effort. In the times he has exerted even a bit more than his regular power, it's apparent his strength is comparable to Super Saiyan levels. The audience can only imagine how powerful Saitama could possibly get if he goes beyond his normal and serious punches.qw`s Saitama, on the other hand, has only mentioned sticking to his daily work out of 100 push-ups, situps, squats and a 10km run. From what has transpired in the anime, it appears like there is no need for him to improve or change. If harsher training has increased Goku's power, this should also apply to Saitama. He reached his current status by only relying on traditional methods. It is reasonable to hypothesize that if Saitama trained the exact same way Goku did, he would be far more powerful than Goku.</br>

<br>The video clip, which is available on the Etoilec1 Animation YouTube channel, begins with battle-happy Goku wishing upon the Dragon Balls, asking for the strongest opponent to fight. Shenron obliges by summoning none other than the One Punch Man protagonist himself, Saitama. The ensuing fight manifests with a deluge of over-the-top action containing references to both iconic anime series.The ongoing One-Punch Man manga by One first appeared on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump website in June 2012. So far, the series has produced 27 volumes worth of content. The story focuses on Saitama, who starts out as an average Joe until he discovers the joys of fighting monsters. While not inherently gifted with any powers, he becomes the titular hero by doing a lot of sit-ups and push-ups. Over 30 million copies of One-Punch Man have been sold globally and, in 2015, the series was nominated for an Eisner Award.</br>

<br>Goku, on the other hand, is always in situations where his battle IQ is being heightened. Nearly every fight we see Goku in, he has to push beyond his limits to overcome his opponent. Always having to be the overcomer ensures one's battle prowess is maintained.

Unfortunately for the One Punch Man, Saitama’s quick work of Dragon Level Threats leaves something to be desired in terms of his battle skill and knowledge. As a result, Goku takes home the gold in the win against Saitama from One Punch Man for best battle IQ.</br>
